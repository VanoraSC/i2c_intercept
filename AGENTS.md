# Repository Guidelines

- All source code in this repository must be thoroughly commented. Every function and significant logic block should include descriptive comments that explain what the code does and why.
- The `legacy/` directory is excluded from these requirements and should not be modified.
- When modifying or adding code, ensure the resulting files contain clear comments that maintain these standards.
- Any new program or library added to the repository must have corresponding build and clean targets in the top-level `Makefile` so it can be compiled alongside the rest of the project.
